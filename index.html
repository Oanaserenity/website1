<h2>Green resources
and
the positive impact of new technologies</h2>

<p> <b>Green tech refers to a type of technology that is considered environmentally friendly based on its production process or its supply chain. Green tech—an abbreviation of "green technology"—can also refer to clean energy production, the use of alternative fuels, and technologies that are less harmful to the environment than fossil fuels.</b> 
</p>
 
 <p><br> <b><b>Here is a list of some well-known environmental advancements that you may not be familiar with:</b><p> </b><br>
  Water filtration and wastewater treatment (recycling water to make it drinkable, or clean enough for other purposes)
  <br>Management of waste and recycling (minimizing landfill and their impact)
  <br>Energy from waste (burning landfill to generate electricity)
  <br>Electric transportation (scooters, buses, lorries, vehicles — you name it)
  <br>Programmable thermostats (which allow you to set temps when you’re away from home to conserve energy).<br>

  Self-sufficient structures (buildings that produce enough energy to power themselves, generally through solar panels)<br>
  Low-carbon building (developing energy-efficient buildings made with green materials and smaller footprints)  <br>Carbon sequestration and storage (capturing and removing carbon from the atmosphere)
  <br>LED illumination (ultra-energy-efficient light bulbs)
  <br>Vertical agriculture (uses less land, less water, and can be set up in cities)
  <br>Making compost (turning food waste into fertilizer)
  <br>Wave power (using ocean waves to generate electricity)
  <br>
  Battery (energy storage is crucial in the transition to renewables)
  <br>
  Carbon tracking software (yes, that’s us – software that determines your company’s carbon footprints);
  Green materials (local, renewable materials like bamboo, hemp, and straw</p>
